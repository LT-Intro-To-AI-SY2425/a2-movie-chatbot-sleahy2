# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

I would sometimes get confused when trying to manipulate variables by doing something that I had not seen or learned before. For example, I did not know how to use rstrip(), but after we went over it, I understood.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

When looking for a director, or a year it was made, etc. it could match that information to the information in the movie database. For example, if looking for a movie by Steven Spielberg, it could find all the movies by Stielberg in the movie database.
